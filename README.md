# The Impact of AI on Wage Equity in Canada (2012–2024)

## Overview
This project analyzes how artificial intelligence (AI) has affected wage growth and inequality in Canada, focusing on differences across occupations, gender, and provinces.

Using data from Statistics Canada, we examine whether AI-related occupations experience a wage premium, when that premium emerged, and which groups benefit or face barriers in the evolving AI-driven labor market.

## Research Questions
- How have wages evolved for AI-related vs non-AI occupations?
- When did the AI wage premium emerge?
- How does inflation affect real wage growth?
- Do gender and provincial disparities persist within AI occupations?

## Data Sources
- Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey wage data (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024)
- Statistics Canada Table 14-10-0417-01

## Key Findings
- The AI wage premium accelerates after 2020
- AI occupations show higher real wage growth than non-AI occupations
- Gender wage gaps persist within AI roles
- AI wage benefits are concentrated in Ontario and British Columbia
