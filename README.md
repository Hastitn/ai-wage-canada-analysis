# The Impact of AI on Wage Equity in Canada (2012–2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how artificial intelligence (AI) has reshaped wage growth and inequality in Canada, with a focus on occupational differences, gender disparities, and provincial variation.

Using publicly available data from Statistics Canada, we evaluate whether AI-related occupations experience a wage premium, identify when this premium emerged, and assess which demographic and geographic groups benefit—or face barriers—in Canada’s evolving AI-driven labor market.

## Research Questions
- How have wages evolved for AI-related occupations compared to non-AI occupations between 2012 and 2024?
- When did the AI wage premium emerge, and has it accelerated over time?
- How does inflation adjustment affect conclusions about real wage growth?
- Do gender and provincial wage disparities persist within AI-related occupations?

## Data Sources
- **Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey** wage data (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024)
- **Statistics Canada Table 14-10-0417-01**  
  (Wages by occupation, gender, and province)

## Methodology
- Identified AI-related occupations using a keyword-based occupational classification approach  
- Standardized wages to annual values and adjusted for inflation using CPI (2024 constant dollars)  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and comparative trend analysis  
- Examined wage distributions, real wage growth, and gender wage gaps across provinces  

## Key Findings
- The AI wage premium is a recent phenomenon, accelerating notably after 2020  
- AI-related occupations exhibit higher real wage growth than non-AI occupations  
- Gender wage gaps persist within AI roles despite higher average wages  
- AI-related wage gains are geographically concentrated, particularly in Ontario and British Columbia
